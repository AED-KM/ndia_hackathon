## Summary
I. Data Sources (MHS Genesis - Air Force Active Duty Pilots):
We'll focus on data elements readily available within MHS Genesis. This assumes a timeframe of the last 5 years for trend analysis.
•	Demographics: Age, Gender, Rank, Flight Hours (Total, Last 12 Months), Aircraft Type.
•	Medical Encounters: ICD-10 diagnoses, CPT procedures, Medications Prescribed, Visit Types (Primary Care, Specialty Care, Urgent Care, etc.).
•	Preventive Care: Immunization Records, Periodic Health Assessments (PHAs), Flight Physicals (results – vision, hearing, cardiovascular, neurological).
•	Laboratory Results: Common labs relevant to pilot medical standards (CBC, CMP, Lipid Panel, etc.).
•	Aeromedical Classifications: Current and historical aeromedical classifications (Class I, II, III, Temporary Profile).
•	Profile Data: Any temporary or permanent profiles restricting flight duties (reason, duration).
•	Mental Health Data: (De-identified) Diagnoses, medications, therapy sessions. Requires strict adherence to privacy regulations.
•	Hospitalizations/Emergency Department Visits: Reason for encounter, length of stay.
II. Analytical Approach:
We'll use a combination of descriptive statistics, trend analysis, and predictive modeling.
1.	Descriptive Statistics: Calculate baseline metrics for the pilot population (average age, flight hours, distribution of aeromedical classifications).
2.	Medical Readiness Indicators: Define key indicators of medical readiness:
•	PHA Completion Rate: Percentage of pilots completing PHAs within the required timeframe.
•	Dental Readiness
•	medical equipment assessment 
•	Deployment-limiting medical and dental conditions.
•	Medical readiness laboratory studies 
•	Immunization status 
3.	Trend Analysis: Track changes in these indicators over time to identify emerging trends and potential areas of concern.
4.	Predictive Modeling (Focus: Profile Risk): Develop a machine learning model to predict the risk of a pilot being placed on a flight duty restricting profile. Features would include demographics, medical history, lab results, and PHA findings. (Logistic Regression or Random Forest would be suitable algorithms).
5.	Correlation Analysis: Identify correlations between medical conditions, lifestyle factors (e.g., flight hours, sleep patterns – if available), and medical readiness indicators.
III. Prototype Dashboard Visualization (we can use either R or Python (PandasAI )– Conceptual): 
The data loaded into Pandas DataFrames. The Python code demonstrating how PandasAI could be used to generate visualizations. 
Dashboard Components:
•	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): PHA Completion Rate, Flight Physical Compliance, Aeromedical Classification Stability, Profile Rate. (Displayed as numbers with trend indicators).
•	Trend Charts: Profile Rate over Time, Chronic Condition Prevalence over Time.
•	Distribution Charts: Aeromedical Classification Distribution, Age Distribution.
•	Geographic Map: (Optional) Visualize the distribution of pilots and medical readiness indicators by base location.
•	Drill-Down Capabilities: Allow users to drill down into specific data points to investigate underlying causes.
•	Predictive Risk Scores: Display individual pilot risk scores (with appropriate access controls).


IV. Next Steps & Considerations:
•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: MHS Genesis data can be complex and require significant cleaning and preprocessing.
•	Integration with Existing Systems: Integrate the dashboard with existing MHS Genesis workflows.
•	Ethical Considerations: Address potential biases in the data and ensure fairness and equity in the application of AI.
This prototype provides a framework for leveraging MHS Genesis data to improve medical readiness for Air Force active-duty pilots.
